## Overview

This project showcases the Proxy Design Pattern by wrapping a `RemoteFileProxy` around `RealRemoteFile` objects to add caching and optimize remote file requests. The client (user) interacts with files through the proxy, which hides the complexity of retrieving and caching remote files[files:21][files:23].

## Project Structure

| File/Class          | Description                                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| RemoteFileSystem.java | Main client loop to interactively access files[files:22]. |
| RemoteFileProxy.java  | Proxy class; caches files, delegates to real file[files:21]. |
| RealRemoteFile.java   | Simulates retrieval and display of remote file[files:23]. |
| RemoteFile.java       | Interface; unified file access contract[files:24]. |

---

## How It Works

- The client requests files through the `RemoteFileProxy`.
- The proxy checks if the requested file exists in its cache:
  - If present: returns the cached object, saving remote server calls.
  - If not present: fetches the file from the remote server, caches it, then returns it.
- `RealRemoteFile` simulates a time-consuming operation when accessing remote files, representing network delay.

## Running the Example

1. **Compile all Java files**
    ```
    javac *.java
    ```

2. **Run the main class**
    ```
    java RemoteFileSystem
    ```
