## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use the **Builder Pattern** in Java to construct complex objects step by step.

It allows you to create two types of travel packages:
- **Budget Travel Package**
- **Luxury Travel Package**

---

## Features
- Create **Budget** or **Luxury** travel packages.
- Each package includes:
  - Flight details
  - Hotel details
  - Car rental information
  - Tours included
- Clear separation between **construction process** and **final product**.
- Easy to extend (e.g., adding new package types).

---

## Design Pattern Used
- **Builder Design Pattern**  
  - **Product**: `TravelPackage` (the final object)  
  - **Builder Interface**: `TravelPackageBuilder`  
  - **Concrete Builders**: `BudgetTravelPackageBuilder`, `LuxuryTravelPackageBuilder`  
  - **Director**: `TravelPackageDirector`  
  - **Client**: `TravelPackageClient` (demonstrates usage)

This pattern helps build different representations of an object using the same construction process.
