# Virtual Classroom Manager ðŸŽ“

A **terminal-based backend application** for an EdTech platform.
It allows you to manage virtual classrooms, students, and assignments from the command line.
Built using **Java** with a clean architecture and design patterns (**Command Design Pattern**, **SOLID**).

## Overview

The **Virtual Classroom Manager** simulates the backend of a virtual classroom system.

It manages:

* Classrooms
* Student enrollments
* Scheduling and submission of assignments

The application runs entirely in a **terminal (CLI)** and focuses on:

* **Logic**
* **Code quality**
* **Maintainability**
* **Design patterns**

---

## Features

* **Classroom Management**
  Add, list, and remove virtual classrooms.
* **Student Management**
  Enroll students into classrooms and list students per class.
* **Assignment Management**
  Schedule assignments for classes and submit assignments per student.
* **Command Pattern Implementation**
  Each user command is encapsulated as a command object.
* **Logging**
  All actions and errors are logged to console.
* **Validation & Exceptions**
  Input validation and custom exceptions ensure robust error handling.

---

## Architecture & Design Patterns

* **Command Pattern** â€“ Each user input (`ADD_CLASSROOM`, `ADD_STUDENT`, etc.) maps to a command class.
* **SOLID Principles** â€“ Code is modular, open for extension, and closed for modification.
* **Separation of Concerns** â€“ Distinct packages for commands, models, validation, and exceptions.

## Prerequisites

* Java 17+ (or compatible JDK)
* Git

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Umeshwar-Dev/EI_2025-26_Coding_Exercise/Ex2/VirtualClassroomManager.git

## Logging & Error Handling

* Uses `java.util.logging.Logger` for logging.
* Input validation via `validation` package.
* Custom exceptions handle specific error cases gracefully.
